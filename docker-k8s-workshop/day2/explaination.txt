SCENARIO 1
multinode-demo has a taint: dedicated=day1:NoSchedule
This means no pods will be scheduled on it unless they explicitly tolerate this taint.

multinode-demo-m02 has a label: disk=ssd
The pod uses node affinity to schedule only on nodes with this label.

So he pod will only be scheduled on 'multinode-demo-m02' as it matched the affinity label.

SCENARIO-2 

None of node has either the taint or the label, the pod will remain in a Pending state because no node satisfies the conditions.
