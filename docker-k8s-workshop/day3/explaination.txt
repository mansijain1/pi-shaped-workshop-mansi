ClusterIP (Internal Access)

Exposes the app internally within the Kubernetes cluster only and accessible from other pods/services inside the cluster.
So to Access we need to use port forward using kubectl port-forward service/web-service-clusterip 8080:80 for local development. 
Than we can see the nginx service on localhost:8080

NodePort (External Access)

Makes the app accessible outside the cluster on a static port.
In this case the node port assigned is 32619 by Kubernetes default system. So we can access from any external system via the Minikube IP and assigned node port.
